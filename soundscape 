It all starts with sounds to overwhelm the listener. People talking, laughing, screaming -- all things that can overwhelm the auditory stystem when combined together. You hear cars on the street and the subject of the narative trying to get away from the bustle. She is overwhelmed and needs to find a quiet place. She gets home, takes her anxiety meds and calls her friend while undergoing an anxiety attack. For myself I sometimes forget to take my medication and can end up in a similar sort of narative. All of the sounds used in the piece are orginal and were recorded by myself. The sound of others is my roomates, and the main actor is myself. I liked the idea of an abrupt ending because when I get anxious everything feels abrupt in nature. I overallwanted to challenge myself in recording every sound that I used, and tested my editing skills by clipping certain audio together that were recorded seperately such as the pill taking and phone call that comes imedietly after.
